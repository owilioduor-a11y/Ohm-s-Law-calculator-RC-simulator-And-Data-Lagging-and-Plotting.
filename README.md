## Ohm’s Law Calculator, RC Simulator & Data LoggerWelcome to the Ohm’s Law Calculator & RC Simulator. 
This project is a versatile Python-based tool designed for students, hobbyists, and engineers. 
It combines fundamental circuit calculations with dynamic RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit simulations, 
featuring real-time data logging and visualization.
## Key Features
# Ohm’s Law Calculator:
Solve for Voltage (v), Current (I), or Resistance (R) instantly.
# RC Circuit Simulator:
Simulate the charging and discharging behavior of capacitors.
Calculates the time constant T= R x C.Models voltage across the capacitor over time using V(t) = V_0(1 - e^{-t/\tau}).
# Data Logging:
Automatically logs simulation results to .csv or .txt files for later analysis.Dynamic Plotting: Generates clean, professional graphs of voltage and current curves using Matplotlib.
